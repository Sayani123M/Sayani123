About Me:
I'm a passionate and aspiring programmer diving into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). With a background in coding and frontend, I'm eager to explore the depths of algorithmic thinking and interactive web .
- ðŸ‘€ Future Interests: Learning more of back-end to make my web applications interactive and fun. Also looking forward to collaborate on hackathons or projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning dsa
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Her/She
- âš¡ Fun fact:  I often get frustrated when debugging, only to discover that my logic was correct all alongâ€”it's just that I used = instead of == in my code. It's a common mistake I make, but it keeps me humble and always double-checking my syntax!
- Get in Touch

ðŸ’¬ Open to collaborations and eager to learn from fellow developers.
